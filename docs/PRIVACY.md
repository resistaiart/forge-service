# Privacy Policy for The Forge Project

_Last updated: August 28, 2025_

The Forge Project ("we", "our" or "us") provides tooling that helps users generate structured prompt packages for ComfyUI through integration with the Forge API hosted on Railway. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user data.

---

## 1. Information We Collect
- **User Inputs:** Prompts, configuration settings, and workflow parameters that you provide to The Forge GPT interface.
- **API Requests:** When you use The Forge, your inputs are transmitted to our Forge API service hosted on [Railway](https://railway.app).
- **Metadata:** Optional captions or labels that you include with your prompt packages.

We **do not** collect personally identifiable information (PII) unless you explicitly provide it in your inputs. We encourage you not to submit any PII.

---

## 2. How We Use Information
- To generate, optimise, and return reproducible prompt packages for use in ComfyUI.
- To maintain service reliability and improve system performance.
- To enforce safety and compliance rules (e.g., blocking non-consensual or minor-related content).

---

## 3. Data Storage & Retention
- User inputs are processed in memory and transmitted securely to our Forge API.
- We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.
- Logs may be temporarily stored for debugging and performance monitoring but are purged **within 7 days**.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services
The Forge relies on:
- **Railway** for API hosting and infrastructure.
- **GitHub** for documentation and code hosting.
- **OpenAI** for providing the GPT interface.

Each third-party service has its own privacy policy, and we encourage you to review them.

---

## 5. Your Choices
- You can choose not to provide optional inputs (e.g., captions).
- You can reset or clear locked values in The Forge at any time (`unlock: all`).

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy
The Forge is **not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18**. We actively block prompts involving minors or non-consensual material.

---

## 7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Updates will be published to this GitHub repository with a revised “Last updated” date.
