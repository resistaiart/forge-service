# The Forge Project 🔨🔥

> **Generate optimised, production-ready prompt packages for Stable Diffusion and ComfyUI**

The Forge analyses your goal and crafts a perfect set of instructions—prompts, model settings, negative prompts, and resources—to get the best possible output from your AI image and video generation workflows.

## 🚀 Quick Start (60 Seconds)

### For End Users (Using the API)

**1. Analyse an image to get a detailed description:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-forge-api.com/analyse \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "image_url": "https://example.com/your-art.jpg", 
    "mode": "detailed"
  }'
```

**2. Generate an optimised prompt package for AI art:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-forge-api.com/optimise \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "package_goal": "t2i",
    "prompt": "cyberpunk samurai in neon-lit Tokyo streets",
    "resources": ["cyberpunk_lora.safetensors"]
  }'
```

### For ChatGPT Users

Simply say: **"Fire up the forge"** to start creating optimised prompt packages through conversation.

## 🧠 Philosophy & Architecture

> *"I am The Forge Project. My mission is simple: I do not render images or videos. I engineer the inputs that ensure rendering succeeds."*

### The Problem

AI art workflows are fragmented across dozens of tools and platforms. Prompts, captions, checkpoints, LoRAs, configs, and workflow graphs are scattered everywhere. This fragmentation wastes creative cycles and kills momentum.

### The Solution: Prompt Packages

**Prompt Packages are synchronised, structured blueprints** that eliminate fragmentation. Each package:

- **Ties directly** to exact ComfyUI workflows (text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video)
- **Optimises every parameter** - checkpoints, samplers, schedulers, resolutions, LoRAs, seeds
- **Is versioned and documented** for quality, speed, and fidelity
- **Records what changed** and why it changed
- **Remains auditable, reusable, and scalable**

### Technical Architecture

Built with modern Python tools:
- **FastAPI** - High-performance web framework
- **Pydantic** - Data validation and serialization
- **Hugging Face Inference** - AI model integration
- **Uvicorn** - Lightning-fast ASGI server

Key modules include `forge_prompts.py`, `forge_image_analysis.py`, `forge_resources.py`, and `forge_settings.py` - each handling a specific aspect of the package generation process.
