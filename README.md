# The Forge Project 🔨🔥

> **Generate optimised, production-ready prompt packages for Stable Diffusion and ComfyUI**

## Overview

**Forge Service** is a powerful backend API service designed to provide customizable, AI-powered content generation capabilities. It supports a variety of goals, including **Text-to-Image** (T2I), **Image-to-Image** (I2I), **Text-to-Video** (T2V), and **Image Upscaling**. Built using **FastAPI**, the service handles requests related to content generation, integrates safety filters, provides detailed diagnostics, and offers a flexible workflow for generating high-quality AI-generated visuals.

## Features

- **Text-to-Image (T2I)**: Generate images based on textual prompts.
- **Image-to-Image (I2I)**: Transform existing images based on new prompts.
- **Text-to-Video (T2V)**: Create videos from textual descriptions.
- **Image Upscaling**: Enhance the resolution of images using AI.
- **Interrogate/Captioning**: Analyze and caption images using advanced AI models.
- **Content Safety Scrubbing**: Ensures content is free from NSFW or disallowed elements.
- **User Profiles**: Personalize content generation settings per user.
- **Comprehensive Diagnostics**: Provides detailed explanations of the chosen settings and alternative options.
- **Integration Support**: Easily integrates with external APIs and services.

## Key Components

### API Endpoints
- **/v2/optimise**: Optimizes content generation (e.g., T2I, I2I, T2V).
- **/v2/analyse**: Analyzes images and generates captions.
- **/health**: Checks the health status of the service.
- **/version**: Returns the current version of the Forge service.
- **/manifest**: Serves the Forge manifest as raw JSON.

### Core Files
- **main.py**: The entry point for the FastAPI app. It defines the web server and routes for various functionalities like health checks, manifest routes, and sealed/legacy API routes.
- **forge/workflows.py**: Handles the core logic for generating and optimizing images/videos based on the user's request.
- **forge/prompts.py**: Builds and cleans prompts, applies custom weights, and analyzes the prompt style for optimized content generation.
- **forge/settings.py**: Contains default settings for different goals (e.g., T2I, I2V), with support for customization based on user profiles.
- **forge/safety.py**: Ensures that the generated content adheres to safety standards by blocking or modifying problematic content (e.g., NSFW, explicit content).
- **forge/resources.py**: Manages resources like models, checkpoints, and datasets, validating them for content generation.
- **forge/captions.py**: Generates captions for the images, allowing the user to provide descriptions in various styles and tones.
- **forge/diagnostics.py**: Provides insights into the performance of different settings, the reasoning behind choices, and alternative configurations for optimization.
- **forge/integrations.py**: Manages external integrations and adds additional features like interacting with other APIs or services.
- **forge/profiles.py**: Manages user profiles, including their preferences for content generation and adjusts the settings accordingly.

## ✨ What Does The Forge Do?

The Forge GPT takes your creative ideas and turns them into engineered specifications that Comfyui understand perfectly:

- **🎯 Prompt Optimisation**: Transforms basic prompts into highly detailed, weighted instructions
- **🖼️ Image Analysis**: Provides detailed descriptions and captions for any image
- **⚙️ Smart Settings**: Automatically recommends optimal model settings, samplers, and parameters
- **📦 Resource Management**: Validates and suggests the best models, LoRAs, and checkpoints
- **🔧 Workflow Integration**: Creates ready-to-use packages for ComfyUI and other AI tools

## 📖 API Reference

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/optimise` | Create optimized prompt packages |
| `POST` | `/analyse` | Analyze images and generate descriptions |
| `GET`  | `/health` | Check API status |

### Example Package Output

```json
{
  "goal": "t2i",
  "positive_prompt": "((cyberpunk:1.4)) ((samurai:1.3)) warrior in ((neon:1.3))-lit Tokyo streets at night, cinematic masterpiece",
  "negative_prompt": "blurry, low quality, watermark, bad anatomy, deformed",
  "settings": {
    "checkpoint": "forge-base-v1.safetensors",
    "sampler": "DPM++ 2M Karras",
    "steps": 28,
    "cfg_scale": 8.0,
    "resolution": "832x1216"
  },
  "resources": ["cyberpunk_lora.safetensors"],
  "diagnostics": {
    "cfg_reason": "CFG 8.0 optimised for cyberpunk style",
    "detected_style": "cyberpunk"
  }
}
```

### Configuration

**Forge Service allows for deep customisation through user profiles, which store preferences such as:**
- Preferred Sampler
- Resolution
- Aspect Ratio
- Content Preferences (e.g., allow NSFW)
**These profiles are stored and used to adapt the settings for each generation request, ensuring personalised output.**

### Diagnostics
**The service provides detailed diagnostics explaining optimisation choices, such as:**
- CFG scale (controls creativity vs. prompt adherence)
- Sampler choice (e.g., Euler vs. DPM)
- Resolution (e.g., 832x1216 for general use, or 1024x1024 for upscaling)
- Steps (higher steps = higher quality, but slower generation)
**Diagnostics also include alternative options for each setting, helping users understand how to tweak their settings for different outcomes.**

### Safety Scrubbing
**Safety scrubbing ensures that no harmful or disallowed content is used in the prompt. The service filters out:**
- NSFW or explicit content
- Child-related terms or youth-coded tokens
- Other unwanted keywords such as abuse or violence

### Integrations
**The Forge Service can integrate with various external systems, such as:**
- External APIs: Can connect to platforms like HuggingFace, CivitAI, etc.
- Workflow Patches: Supports ComfyUI patches for user-specific workflows.

## 🧠 Philosophy & Architecture

> *"I am The Forge Project. My mission is simple: I do not render images or videos. I engineer the inputs that ensure rendering succeeds."*

### The Problem

AI art workflows are fragmented across dozens of tools and platforms. Prompts, captions, checkpoints, LoRAs, configs, and workflow graphs are scattered everywhere. This fragmentation wastes creative cycles and kills momentum.

### The Solution: Prompt Packages

**Prompt Packages are synchronised, structured blueprints** that eliminate fragmentation. Each package:**

- **Ties directly** to exact ComfyUI workflows (text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video)
- **Optimises every parameter** - checkpoints, samplers, schedulers, resolutions, LoRAs, seeds
- **Is versioned and documented** for quality, speed, and fidelity
- **Records what changed** and why it changed
- **Remains auditable, reusable, and scalable**

### Technical Architecture

Built with modern Python tools:
- **FastAPI** - High-performance web framework
- **Pydantic** - Data validation and serialization
- **Hugging Face Inference** - AI model integration
- **Uvicorn** - Lightning-fast ASGI server

Key modules include `forge_prompts.py`, `forge_image_analysis.py`, `forge_resources.py`, and `forge_settings.py` - each handling a specific aspect of the package generation process.
